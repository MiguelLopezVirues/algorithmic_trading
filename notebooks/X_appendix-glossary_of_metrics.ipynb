    "## Maximum Drawdown (MDD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is a risk metric used to assess the largest single drop from peak to trough in the value of an investment portfolio, before a new peak is achieved. It measures the worst possible loss an investor could have experienced over a specific period, providing insight into the downside risk of an investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "MDD is particularly useful for evaluating the risk of investment strategies, as it highlights the potential for significant losses during periods of market stress. It is often expressed as a percentage of the peak value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula and Calculation of Maximum Drawdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Maximum Drawdown is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MDD} = \\frac{\\text{Trough Value} - \\text{Peak Value}}{\\text{Peak Value}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **Trough Value** = The lowest value of the portfolio before a new peak is reached.\n",
    "- **Peak Value** = The highest value of the portfolio before the drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate MDD:\n",
    "1. Identify the highest peak value of the portfolio.\n",
    "2. Identify the lowest trough value after the peak.\n",
    "3. Apply the formula to find the percentage drop from the peak to the trough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Maximum Drawdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose an investment portfolio has the following values over a period:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Day 1: $100,000 (Peak)\n",
    "- Day 2: $95,000\n",
    "- Day 3: $90,000 (Trough)\n",
    "- Day 4: $110,000 (New Peak)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Maximum Drawdown would be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MDD} = \\frac{90,000 - 100,000}{100,000} = -10\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates a 10% drawdown from the peak value of $100,000 to the trough value of $90,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Maximum Drawdown measures the largest single drop from peak to trough in portfolio value.\n",
    "- **Risk Assessment**: It is a key metric for understanding the downside risk of an investment.\n",
    "- **Percentage-Based**: MDD is expressed as a percentage of the peak value.\n",
    "- **Historical Insight**: It provides insight into the worst-case scenario for an investment over a specific period.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: MDD does not account for the frequency or duration of drawdowns, only the magnitude."

    "## Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sharpe ratio compares the return of an investment with its risk. It's a mathematical expression of the insight that excess returns over a period of time may signify more volatility and risk, rather than investing skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economist William F. Sharpe proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966 as an outgrowth of his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), calling it the reward-to-variability ratio. Sharpe won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on CAPM in 1990.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sharpe ratio's numerator is the difference over time between realized, or expected, returns and a benchmark such as the risk-free rate of return or the performance of a particular investment category. Its denominator is the standard deviation of returns over the same period of time, a measure of volatility and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula and Calculation of the Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $R_p$ = Return of portfolio\n",
    "- $R_f$ = Risk-free rate\n",
    "- $\\sigma_p$ = Standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation is derived from the variability of returns for a series of time intervals adding up to the total performance sample under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Sharpe ratio divides a portfolio's excess returns by a measure of its volatility to assess risk-adjusted performance.\n",
    "- Excess returns are those above an industry benchmark or the risk-free rate of return.\n",
    "- The calculation may be based on historical returns or forecasts.\n",
    "- A higher Sharpe ratio is better when comparing similar portfolios.\n",
    "- The Sharpe ratio has inherent weaknesses and may be overstated for some investment strategies.\n"

    "## Sortino Ratio\n",
    "The Sortino ratio is a variation of the Sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns—downside deviation—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula and Calculation of Sortino Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Sortino Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - r_f}{\\sigma_d}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $R_p$ = Actual or expected portfolio return\n",
    "- $r_f$ = Risk-free rate\n",
    "- $\\sigma_d$ = Standard deviation of the downside\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Sortino ratio differs from the Sharpe ratio in that it only considers the standard deviation of the downside risk, rather than that of the entire (upside + downside) risk.\n",
    "- Because the Sortino ratio focuses only on the negative deviation of a portfolio's returns from the mean, it is thought to give a better view of a portfolio's risk-adjusted performance since positive volatility is a benefit.\n",
    "- The Sortino ratio is a useful way for investors, analysts, and portfolio managers to evaluate an investment's return for a given level of bad risk.\n"
